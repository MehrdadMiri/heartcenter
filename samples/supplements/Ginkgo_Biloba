## General Information

### Overview
Ginkgo biloba, commonly known as ginkgo or maidenhair tree, is one of the oldest living tree species. Ginkgo leaves and seeds are traditionally used in herbal medicines. The primary use of ginkgo supplements is to enhance cognitive function and improve memory, but it has also been studied for a variety of other health benefits.

### Common Uses
- **Cognitive Enhancement**: Often marketed as a memory booster and cognitive enhancer, particularly in aging populations.
- **Circulatory Support**: Believed to improve blood flow and support vascular health.
- **Anxiety Relief**: Some studies suggest it might help alleviate symptoms of anxiety.
- **Eye Health**: Antioxidant properties may support vision health, particularly in conditions like age-related macular degeneration.

### Active Compounds
The main active compounds in Ginkgo biloba are:
- **Flavonoids**: Antioxidants that may help protect cells from damage.
- **Terpenoids**: Improve blood circulation by dilating blood vessels and reducing blood viscosity.

## Dosage
Typically, Ginkgo biloba is available in various forms, including capsules, tablets, and liquid extracts. The standard dosage ranges from 120 to 240 mg per day, divided into two or three doses. It is advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized dosages.

## Precautions

- **Blood Thinners**: If you are on anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, aspirin), consult a healthcare provider before use.
- **Pregnancy and Nursing**: Safety during pregnancy or lactation is not well established, so it should be avoided unless prescribed by a healthcare professional.
- **Surgery**: Discontinue use at least two weeks before surgical procedures due to potential bleeding risk.

## Conclusion
