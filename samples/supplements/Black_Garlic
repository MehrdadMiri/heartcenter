# Black Garlic: A Comprehensive Overview

## General Information

**Black garlic** is a type of aged garlic that undergoes a fermentation process, turning the cloves black and giving them a sweet, tangy flavor. This unique preparation method enhances various compounds found in raw garlic, leading to potential health benefits. Black garlic has been used in traditional medicine in various cultures, particularly in Asia, for centuries.

### Nutritional Profile

Black garlic is rich in:

- **Antioxidants**: Contains higher levels of antioxidants compared to raw garlic.
- **Allicin**: Though the fermentation process diminishes allicin levels, it enhances other beneficial compounds like S-allylcysteine.
- **Vitamins and Minerals**: Includes significant amounts of vitamins B6, C, and several minerals such as manganese, calcium, and iron.

### Potential Health Benefits

1. **Cardiovascular Health**: May help reduce cholesterol levels and improve blood circulation.

3. **Antioxidant Effects**: Helps protect cells from oxidative stress, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases.
