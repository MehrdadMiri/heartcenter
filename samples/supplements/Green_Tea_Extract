# Green Tea Extract

## General Information

Green Tea Extract is derived from the leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant. It is a concentrated source of bioactive compounds, particularly polyphenols such as catechins and flavonoids, which are thought to be responsible for many of its health benefits. The primary component, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), is recognized for its antioxidant properties.

### Forms of Green Tea Extract

- **Powder**: Can be mixed into drinks or foods.

3. **Heart health**: Can improve cholesterol levels and promote cardiovascular health.
4. **Brain health**: Potential neuroprotective effects that may support cognitive function and reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.
