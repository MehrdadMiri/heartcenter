# Sesame Oil

## General Information

Sesame oil is derived from sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum), a flowering plant native to the African and Asian regions. It is widely used in cooking and traditional medicine and is noted for its distinct flavor and numerous health benefits. Sesame oil can be classified into two main types: **refined** and **unrefined** (or toasted). 

- **Refined Sesame Oil**: This type has a light flavor and high smoke point, making it suitable for frying and cooking.
- **Unrefined (Toasted) Sesame Oil**: This variant has a darker color and a stronger taste, typically used as a finishing oil or in dressings.
