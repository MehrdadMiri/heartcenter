# Trimetazidine

## Overview
Trimetazidine is a medication primarily used to treat angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart) and to improve the efficiency of the heart muscle. It works by optimizing cellular metabolism and enhancing the utilization of glucose, thereby improving energy production in heart cells. Sometimes it is used off-label for treating vertigo and tinnitus.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Angina Pectoris**: Trimetazidine is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks by improving myocardial energy metabolism.
- **Vestibular Disorders**: It may be used to manage vertigo and associated symptoms.
- **Tinnitus**: Occasionally, it is utilized as a treatment for tinnitus.

## Side Effects
### Serious Side Effects
- **Parkinsonian Symptoms**: This includes tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which can lead to difficulty in movement.
- **Asystole**: A potentially life-threatening decrease in heart rate.
- **Hypersensitivity Reactions**: Severe allergic reactions that may require immediate medical attention.

### Other Side Effects
- **Gastrointestinal Disturbances**: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
- **Dizziness or Headache**: Commonly reported by users.
- **Fatigue and Weakness**: Some patients may experience unusual tiredness.
- **Skin Reactions**: Rash or pruritus may occur.
- **Weight Gain**: Some users report an increase in weight.

## Interactions
Trimetazidine may interact with the following medications:
- **Levodopa**: It may potentiate the dopaminergic effects of levodopa and can lead to enhanced side effects.
- **Antidepressants**: Use with caution, as it may increase the risk of side effects like drowsiness.
- **Other Cardiovascular Drugs**: Care should be taken when used in conjunction with medications that affect heart rhythm or blood pressure.

It is essential for patients to inform their healthcare provider about all medications they are taking to avoid potential interactions.
