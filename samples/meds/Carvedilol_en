# Carvedilol

## Overview
Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with alpha-1 blocking activity commonly used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and congestive heart failure. It helps in reducing heart rate, lowering blood pressure, and improving heart function.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Hypertension**: Lowers blood pressure by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors and causing vasodilation via alpha-1 receptor blockage.
- **Heart Failure**: Improves survival in patients with certain types of heart failure by improving cardiac output and reducing heart workload.
- **Left Ventricular Dysfunction**: It is often prescribed for individuals recovering from heart attacks (post-myocardial infarction) to improve heart function.
- **Angina**: May also be used to treat angina pectoris by reducing heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Severe bradycardia (slow heart rate)
- Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Heart block
- Liver function abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes)
- Worsening heart failure symptoms
- Asthma exacerbation or bronchospasm

### Other Side Effects
- Dizziness or light-headedness
- Fatigue
- Weight gain
- Diarrhea
- Nausea
- Insomnia
- Cold extremities (hands and feet)
- Dry eyes or mouth
- Depression

## Interactions
- **Other Antihypertensives**: Can enhance the blood pressure-lowering effects.
- **Calcium Channel Blockers**: May increase the risk of bradycardia and heart block.
- **Digoxin**: May increase the risk of bradycardia.
- **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**: May reduce the antihypertensive effects of carvedilol.
- **Insulin and Oral Hypoglycemics**: Can mask hypoglycemic symptoms in diabetic patients.
