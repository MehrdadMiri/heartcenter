# Phenylephrine

## Overview
Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic amine that primarily acts as a selective alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist. It is commonly used as a decongestant and vasopressor. Phenylephrine is available in various forms, including oral tablets, nasal spray, and intravenous injections.

### Main Effects and Uses
- **Decongestant**: Reduces nasal congestion by constricting blood vessels in the nasal passages.
- **Vasopressor**: Increases blood pressure in hypotensive states, particularly during anesthesia or shock.
- **Mydriatic**: Induces pupil dilation for ophthalmic procedures.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Hypertension (elevated blood pressure)
- Reflex bradycardia (slowed heart rate)
- Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats)
- Significant tissue necrosis (if extravasation occurs during intravenous administration)

### Other Side Effects
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Nervousness or anxiety
- Insomnia
- Increased sweating
- Nausea or vomiting
- Dry mouth

## Interactions
- **Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)**: Concurrent use can increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **Tricyclic antidepressants**: May potentiate the pressor effects of phenylephrine.
- **Beta-blockers**: May negate the effects of phenylephrine, as they can counteract the adrenergic response.
- **Digoxin**: Risk of increased digoxin toxicity with the use of sympathomimetics.

Always consult a healthcare provider before starting or combining medications.
