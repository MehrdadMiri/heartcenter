# Amlodipine

## Overview
Amlodipine is a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker primarily used to manage hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina (chest pain). It works by relaxing the blood vessels, allowing for improved blood flow and reduced workload on the heart.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Hypertension**: Amlodipine is commonly prescribed to lower blood pressure in adults and children over 6 years old.
- **Angina**: It helps prevent chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.
- **Coronary Artery Disease**: Amlodipine is also used in patients with reduced blood flow to the heart muscles (coronary artery disease).

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Swelling of the hands, feet, or ankles (peripheral edema)
- Severe hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Heart attack or worsening angina
- Liver problems (jaundice, dark urine, abdominal pain)
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling, trouble breathing)

### Other Side Effects
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Flushing (warmth or redness of the face)
- Palpitations
- Headache
- Stomach pain

## Interactions
- **Other Antihypertensives**: May enhance the blood pressure-lowering effects.
- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors**: Medications that inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme (e.g., certain antifungals like ketoconazole, antibiotics like erythromycin) can increase the levels of amlodipine in the blood, potentially leading to increased side effects.
- **CYP3A4 Inducers**: Medications that induce CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampicin, St. John's wort) may decrease the effectiveness of amlodipine.
- **Grapefruit Juice**: Consuming grapefruit or grapefruit juice may increase blood concentrations of amlodipine, leading to an increased risk of side effects.

Always consult a healthcare provider before starting or stopping any medication, including amlodipine, to ensure safety and appropriateness for your individual health needs.
