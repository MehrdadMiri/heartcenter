# Isradipine

## Overview
Isradipine is a calcium channel blocker primarily used for the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and certain types of angina (chest pain). It works by relaxing the blood vessels, which helps to lower blood pressure and improve blood flow.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Primary Use**: Management of hypertension.
- **Secondary Use**: Treatment of angina pectoris.
- **Mechanism of Action**: Isradipine selectively inhibits calcium ion influx across cardiac and smooth muscle cell membranes during depolarization, consequently relaxing vascular smooth muscle and leading to decreased peripheral resistance and blood pressure.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Severe hypotension (very low blood pressure)
- Syncope (fainting)
- Heart attack or worsening angina
- Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Hepatic impairment

### Other Side Effects
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Flushing
- Headache
- Swelling of the ankles or feet (peripheral edema)
- Fatigue or tiredness
- Nausea
- Abdominal pain
- Palpitations

## Interactions
- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors**: Certain medications that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase the levels of Isradipine in the blood, potentially leading to increased side effects. Examples include ketoconazole and erythromycin.
- **CYP3A4 Inducers**: Drugs that induce CYP3A4 can decrease the effectiveness of Isradipine. Examples include rifampicin and St. John's Wort.
- **Other Antihypertensive Agents**: Co-administration with other antihypertensive drugs may lead to additive hypotensive effects.
- **Beta-Blockers**: Caution is advised when using with beta-blockers as this may increase the risk of bradycardia and hypotension.

Always consult a healthcare provider for a personalized assessment and to understand potential interactions based on your health conditions and other medications you may be taking.
