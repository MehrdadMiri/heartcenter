# Candesartan

## Overview
Candesartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (also known as an ARB) used primarily in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart failure. It works by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels, thereby helping to relax and widen blood vessels, leading to lower blood pressure.

### Main Effects and Uses
- **Hypertension:** Candesartan is utilized to manage high blood pressure, reducing the risk of complications such as heart attack and stroke.
- **Heart Failure:** It is also indicated for the treatment of heart failure, improving symptoms and reducing hospitalizations in patients.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- **Hypotension:** Severe drops in blood pressure, especially after the first dose.
- **Renal Impairment:** Worsening kidney function or acute renal failure, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal issues.
- **Hyperkalemia:** Elevated potassium levels in the blood, which can lead to serious cardiac issues.
- **Angioedema:** Swelling of deeper layers of the skin, especially around the eyes and lips, and in some cases, the throat.

### Other Side Effects
- **Dizziness:** Feeling lightheaded or faint, especially after standing up.
- **Fatigue:** Unusual tiredness.
- **Headache:** Generalized or localized head pain.
- **Nausea:** An unsettled stomach or urge to vomit.
- **Back Pain:** General discomfort in the lower back region.
- **Cough:** A persistent dry cough may occur in some patients.

## Interactions
Candesartan may interact with several medications, including:
- **Diuretics:** Concurrent use may enhance the blood pressure-lowering effect, leading to increased risk of hypotension.
- **Other antihypertensives:** Combining with agents that lower blood pressure can lead to additive effects.
- **Potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics:** Increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** May reduce the antihypertensive effects and increase the risk of renal impairment.

It is essential to inform healthcare providers of all medications being taken to avoid potential interactions and complications.
