# Minoxidil

## Overview
Minoxidil is a vasodilator medication primarily used to treat high blood pressure and promote hair growth in individuals with androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern baldness). It is available in oral forms for hypertension and topical solutions for hair loss.

### Main Effects and Uses
- **Hypertension**: Minoxidil is used to lower blood pressure in patients with severe hypertension, often in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
- **Hair Regrowth**: Topical minoxidil is FDA-approved for promoting hair regrowth in both men and women with diffuse thinning or pattern baldness.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Rapid heart rate (tachycardia)
- Chest pain
- Swelling of hands and feet (edema)
- Unexplained weight gain
- Breathing difficulties
- Allergic reactions including rash, itching or swelling

### Other Side Effects
- Headache
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Flushing (redness or warmth of the skin)
- Nausea
- Skin irritation at the site of topical application
- Increased hair growth in unwanted areas (hypertrichosis)
- Dryness or scaling of the scalp

### Interactions
- **Potassium-sparing diuretics**: Can increase the risk of hyperkalemia (high potassium levels).
- **Beta-blockers**: May lessen the effectiveness of minoxidil in lowering blood pressure.
- **Other antihypertensive medications**: Risk of additive hypotensive effects.
- **Alcohol**: Can enhance the blood-pressure-lowering effect, leading to increased risk of hypotension.
