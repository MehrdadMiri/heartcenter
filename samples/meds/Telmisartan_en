# Overview

**Telmisartan** is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used primarily in the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) and for the reduction of cardiovascular risk in certain patients. By blocking the action of angiotensin II, a substance in the body that causes blood vessels to constrict, Telmisartan helps to relax and widen blood vessels, thereby lowering blood pressure.

## Main Effects and Uses

- **Hypertension Management:** Telmisartan is primarily prescribed to lower blood pressure in adults and can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications.
- **Cardiovascular Risk Reduction:** It is indicated for use in patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks or strokes, especially in patients with conditions like diabetes.
  
# Side Effects

## Serious Side Effects

- **Angioedema:** Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat which may lead to difficulty breathing.
- **Kidney Dysfunction:** Changes in kidney function tests, which may indicate worsening kidney health.
- **Hypotension:** Severe drop in blood pressure, particularly after the first dose or in dehydrated patients.
- **Fetal Toxicity:** Use during pregnancy can harm the developing fetus, particularly during the second and third trimesters.

## Other Side Effects

- **Dizziness**: Feeling lightheaded or faint, especially upon standing.
- **Fatigue**: General tiredness.
- **Back Pain**: Discomfort or pain in the back area.
- **Nausea**: Feeling sick or vomiting.
- **Diarrhea**: Increased bowel movements or loose stools.
- **Muscle Cramps**: Uncomfortable muscle tightness or spasms.
- **Headache**: Pain in the head or neck region.

# Interactions

- **Other Antihypertensives:** Can enhance the blood pressure-lowering effect when used with other antihypertensive agents, potentially leading to hypotension.
- **Diuretics:** Concurrent use may lead to an increased risk of hypotension and renal impairment.
- **Potassium-Sparing Diuretics:** There is a risk of hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), so monitoring of potassium levels is advised.
- **Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):** Can reduce the antihypertensive effect and increase the risk of renal impairment.
- **Lithium:** The use of Telmisartan can increase serum lithium levels, leading to enhanced effects and toxicity.
