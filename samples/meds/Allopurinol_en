# Allopurinol

## Overview
Allopurinol is a medication primarily used to reduce uric acid levels in the blood. It is commonly prescribed for the treatment of gout and certain types of kidney stones, and it may also be used in patients undergoing chemotherapy to prevent hyperuricemia (excess uric acid due to cell breakdown).

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Reduces uric acid production**: Allopurinol inhibits the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is involved in the production of uric acid.
- **Gout management**: It helps to prevent gout attacks by maintaining lower uric acid levels.
- **Kidney stone prevention**: It helps in the prevention of uric acid stones in the kidneys.
- **Management of hyperuricemia**: Used in patients with conditions causing elevated uric acid levels, such as chemotherapy.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome (a serious skin reaction)
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis
- Hepatic toxicity (severe liver damage)
- Bone marrow suppression
- Kidney dysfunction

### Other Side Effects
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Drowsiness
- Rash
- Itching
- Abdominal pain
- Gout flares (initially, during the start of therapy)
- Changes in liver function tests

## Interactions
- **Warfarin**: Allopurinol may enhance the effect of warfarin, increasing the risk of bleeding.
- **Azathioprine and Mercaptopurine**: Allopurinol can significantly increase the toxicity of these drugs by inhibiting their metabolism.
- **Diuretics**: These can increase the risk of hypersensitivity reactions or renal injury when used with allopurinol.
- **Other medications that affect uric acid levels**: Such as probenecid, which can alter the effects of allopurinol.
