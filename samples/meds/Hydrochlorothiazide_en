# Hydrochlorothiazide

## Overview
Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic commonly used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and edema (fluid retention) associated with conditions such as heart failure, renal dysfunction, and cirrhosis. By promoting the excretion of sodium and water through the urine, hydrochlorothiazide helps to lower blood pressure and reduce fluid accumulation.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Management of Hypertension:** Lowers blood pressure by reducing blood volume and relaxing blood vessels.
- **Edema Reduction:** Treats fluid retention caused by conditions like congestive heart failure and kidney disorders.
- **Heart Failure Treatment:** Often used in combination with other medications to improve symptoms related to heart failure.
- **Kidney Stones Prevention:** Sometimes used in preventing calcium-based kidney stones.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Electrolyte imbalances (e.g., low potassium, low sodium)
- Severe allergic reactions (e.g., rash, itching, swelling)
- Jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes)
- Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
- Acute kidney injury
- Gout flare-ups

### Other Side Effects
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Increased urination
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Constipation or diarrhea
- Headaches
- Fatigue
- Dry mouth or thirst

### Interactions
Hydrochlorothiazide may interact with several other medications, including:
- **Other Blood Pressure Medications:** May enhance the effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
- **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):** May reduce the antihypertensive effect of hydrochlorothiazide.
- **Antidiabetic Medications:** May affect blood glucose levels and require monitoring.
- **Lithium:** Hydrochlorothiazide can increase lithium levels, leading to toxicity.
- **Corticosteroids:** May increase the risk of potassium loss when taken together. 

It's essential to inform healthcare providers of all medications being taken to avoid potential interactions.
