# Urokinase

## Overview
Urokinase is an enzyme that is used primarily as a thrombolytic agent, meaning it helps dissolve blood clots. It is most commonly used in the treatment of conditions such as pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and to clear obstructed catheters. Urokinase works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then degrades fibrin and dissolves clots.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Thrombolytic therapy**: Urokinase is employed to dissolve acute blood clots in conditions like:
  - Pulmonary embolism
  - Deep vein thrombosis
  - Myocardial infarction
- **Obstruction clearance**: Used in medical procedures to clear occluded intravenous (IV) catheters.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Hemorrhage (internal or external bleeding)
- Intracranial hemorrhage or strokes due to bleeding in the brain
- Severe hypotension (low blood pressure)

### Other Side Effects
- Nausea and vomiting
- Fever
- Skin rash or itching
- Hematoma formation at the injection site
- Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
- Confusion or dizziness

## Interactions
Urokinase may interact with other medications, particularly those that affect bleeding and coagulation, including:
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin)
- Antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel)
- Other thrombolytics

Patients should inform their healthcare provider of all medications they are taking to avoid potential interactions.
