# Norepinephrine

## Overview
Norepinephrine is a catecholamine and neurotransmitter, primarily used as a medication to treat severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and shock, particularly septic shock. It acts primarily as a potent vasoconstrictor, increasing peripheral resistance and blood pressure. It may also increase cardiac output by enhancing myocardial contractility and heart rate.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Vasoconstriction**: Increases blood pressure by constricting blood vessels.
- **Cardiac stimulant**: Can improve heart contractility and output.
- **Septic Shock**: Primarily used to manage hypotension in patients experiencing septic shock.
- **Cardiogenic Shock**: Utilized in some cases to support heart function during severe heart failure.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- **Severe hypertension**: Excessive increase in blood pressure, posing risks such as stroke or heart failure.
- **Arrhythmias**: Abnormal heart rhythms that can be life-threatening.
- **Extravasation injury**: Tissue necrosis due to leakage of the medication from the vein.
- **Peripheral ischemia**: Reduced blood flow to extremities, potentially leading to tissue damage.
  
### Other Side Effects
- Anxiety or nervousness
- Headache
- Nausea or vomiting
- Limb extremity pain
- Skin blanching or pallor
- Bradycardia (low heart rate)
- Dyspnea (difficulty breathing)
  
## Drug Interactions
- **Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)**: Can enhance pressor effects, leading to significant hypertension.
- **Tricyclic Antidepressants**: May potentiate cardiovascular effects.
- **General Anesthetics**: May increase the risk of cardiopulmonary complications when used together.

> Norepinephrine should be administered under careful medical supervision, and its use requires monitoring for side effects and interactions with other medications.
