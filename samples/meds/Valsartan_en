# Valsartan

## Overview
Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. 

## Main Effects and Uses
- Treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure)
- Management of heart failure
- Reduction of cardiovascular morbidity after a heart attack
- Protective effects for patients with reduced left ventricular function

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
- Hypotension (severely low blood pressure)
- Elevated potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
- Kidney impairment or failure

### Other Side Effects
- Dizziness
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Cough
- Abdominal pain

## Interactions
- **Diuretics:** Increased risk of hypotension and electrolyte imbalance.
- **Other antihypertensives:** May cause additive blood pressure lowering effects.
- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** May reduce the hypotensive effect of Valsartan and can lead to kidney impairment.
- **Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics:** Increased risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Lithium:** Levels may increase, leading to potential toxicity.
