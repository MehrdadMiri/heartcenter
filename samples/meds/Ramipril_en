# Ramipril

## Overview
Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow. Ramipril is also used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with risk factors.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Hypertension**: Effective in lowering high blood pressure.
- **Heart Failure**: Improves symptoms and reduces hospitalization in heart failure patients.
- **Preventing Cardiovascular Events**: Reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, and death in high-risk patients.
- **Diabetic Kidney Disease**: May help protect kidney function in patients with diabetes.

## Side Effects
### Serious Side Effects
- Angioedema (swelling of face, lips, throat, or tongue)
- Severe hypotension (very low blood pressure)
- Kidney problems (elevated creatinine levels or acute kidney injury)
- Liver problems (jaundice, elevated liver enzymes)
- Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)

### Other Side Effects
- Cough
- Dizziness or lightheadedness, especially when standing up
- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Headache
- Rash
- Elevated blood potassium levels
- Changes in taste

## Interactions
- **Diuretics**: May enhance the blood pressure-lowering effect, and the risk of hypotension.
- **Potassium-sparing Diuretics**: Caution is advised, as it may lead to hyperkalemia.
- **NSAIDs**: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce the antihypertensive effect of Ramipril and can increase the risk of kidney problems.
- **Lithium**: Use with caution, as Ramipril may increase lithium levels, leading to toxicity.
- **Other Antihypertensive Agents**: May have additive effects leading to hypotension.
