# Overview
Prasugrel is an antiplatelet medication used to prevent blood clots in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). It works by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation, reducing the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events.

## Main Effects and Uses
Prasugrel is primarily used to:
- Reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular death in patients with ACS.
- Prevent blood clots in patients undergoing PCI, particularly those with a history of cardiovascular issues.

# Side Effects

## Serious Side Effects
- **Severe bleeding:** Law risk of serious and potentially life-threatening bleeding events.
- **Thrombocytopenia:** Low levels of platelets, which may increase bleeding risk.
- **Allergic reactions:** Severe reactions including anaphylaxis in rare cases.
- **Intracranial hemorrhage:** Bleeding within the brain, which can be life-threatening.

## Other Side Effects
- Minor bleeding (e.g., nosebleeds, gum bleeding)
- Bruising
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Fatigue
- Rash or mild skin reactions

# Drug Interactions
Prasugrel may interact with other medications, including:
- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs):** Increased risk of bleeding.
- **Other anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin):** Enhanced anticoagulant effects and bleeding risk.
- **Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs):** May increase bleeding risk.
- **Certain antifungal or antiviral medications:** Can affect metabolism and increase the risk of side effects.

It is essential for patients to inform their healthcare provider of all medications they are taking to avoid potential interactions.
