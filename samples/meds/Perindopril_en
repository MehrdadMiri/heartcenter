# Overview
Perindopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease. It works by relaxing blood vessels, thereby lowering blood pressure and improving blood flow.

## Main Effects and Uses
- Treatment of hypertension
- Management of heart failure
- Reduction of cardiovascular risk in patients with stable coronary artery disease
- Improvement of exercise capacity in patients with heart failure

# Side Effects
## Serious Side Effects
- Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, throat, and tongue)
- Severe hypotension (excessively low blood pressure)
- Kidney impairment or failure
- Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)

## Other Side Effects
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Cough
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Nausea
- Rash
- Abdominal pain 
- Diarrhea

# Drug Interactions
- **Diuretics**: May enhance the blood-pressure-lowering effects and increase the risk of hypotension.
- **Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics**: Can lead to hyperkalemia.
- **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**: May reduce the antihypertensive effect of Perindopril and increase risk of kidney injury.
- **Lithium**: Can increase levels of lithium, requiring monitoring for toxicity.
- **Other antihypertensive agents**: May have additive blood pressure-lowering effects.
