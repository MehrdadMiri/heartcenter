# Overview

**Propafenone** is a Class IC antiarrhythmic medication primarily used to manage and treat certain types of cardiac rhythm disorders, specifically atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. It works by blocking sodium channels in the heart, stabilizing the cardiac cell membrane, and thereby reducing abnormal electrical activity.

## Main Effects and Uses

- **Atrial Fibrillation**: Helps restore normal rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation.
- **Ventricular Tachycardia**: Used in the treatment of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
- **Supraventricular Tachycardia**: Effective in the management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

# Side Effects

## Serious Side Effects

- **Cardiac Arrest**: Rare but can occur due to severe arrhythmias.
- **Heart Failure**: Worsening of existing heart failure symptoms.
- **Severe Liver Damage**: Signs may include jaundice, dark urine, and abdominal pain.
- **Bronchospasm**: Particularly in patients with a history of asthma or respiratory conditions.
- **Blood Dyscrasias**: Including agranulocytosis and a marked decrease in blood cells leading to increased risk of infection.

## Other Side Effects

- **Dizziness**: Feeling lightheaded or faint.
- **Fatigue**: General tiredness or low energy.
- **Nausea**: Upset stomach or the urge to vomit.
- **Constipation**: Difficulty in passing stools.
- **Visual Disturbances**: Including blurred vision or changes in vision.
- **Tremors**: Fine, uncontrollable shaking, particularly of the hands.
- **Headache**: General discomfort or pain in the head.

# Interactions

- **Beta-Blockers**: May increase the risk of bradycardia (slow heart rate) or other cardiac side effects when used in conjunction.
- **Calcium Channel Blockers**: Risk of hypotension and heart rate issues when combined.
- **Antidepressants**: Certain medications like fluoxetine can increase levels of propafenone in the blood, leading to enhanced effects and potential toxicity.
- **Grapefruit Juice**: Should be avoided as it can significantly increase serum levels of propafenone, increasing the risk of side effects.

It is essential to consult healthcare providers for personalized advice, particularly regarding potential interactions with other medications or existing health conditions.
