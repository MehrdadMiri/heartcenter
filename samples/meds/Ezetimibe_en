Ezetimibe is a medication primarily used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood. It works by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol from the small intestine, which leads to a decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Ezetimibe is often prescribed alongside statins to enhance the cholesterol-lowering effect.
