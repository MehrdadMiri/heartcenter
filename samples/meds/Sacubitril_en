# Sacubitril

## Overview
Sacubitril is a medication primarily used in combination with valsartan to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). This combination is marketed under the brand name Entresto. Sacubitril functions as an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), and it works by promoting vasodilation, reducing cardiac workload, and positively influencing heart performance.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Heart Failure Management**: Sacubitril, in combination with valsartan, is used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure.
- **Vasodilation**: It helps to relax blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and reduces the strain on the heart.
- **Natriuretic Peptide Modulation**: By inhibiting neprilysin, sacubitril increases levels of natriuretic peptides that promote diuresis and vasodilation.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- **Angioedema**: Swelling of the deeper layers of the skin, often around the eyes and lips, and sometimes the throat.
- **Hypotension**: Low blood pressure that can lead to dizziness, fainting, or falls.
- **Renal Impairment**: Worsening kidney function, requiring monitoring of renal function.
- **Hyperkalemia**: Elevated potassium levels in the blood, which can cause serious heart problems.

### Other Side Effects
- Dizziness
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Cough
- Nasopharyngitis (common cold)
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Back pain
- Elevated levels of liver enzymes

## Drug Interactions
- **ACE Inhibitors and Other ARBs**: Concurrent use may increase the risk of angioedema.
- **Diuretics**: Can potentially lead to hypotension and electrolyte imbalances.
- **NSAIDs**: May diminish the effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan and can affect renal function.
- **Lithium**: Increased risk of lithium toxicity due to reduced clearance.
