# Overview
Tenecteplase is a thrombolytic agent (clot buster) used primarily in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI or heart attack). It works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which then breaks down fibrin clots in the blood vessels, restoring blood flow to the affected area of the heart.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Main Effects**: Tenecteplase dissolves blood clots that obstruct blood flow, helping to restore circulation.
- **Uses**: 
  - Treatment of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
  - Can also be used in other thrombotic conditions where clot removal is critical

# Side Effects
## Serious Side Effects
- Major bleeding
- Intracranial hemorrhage
- Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Cardiogenic shock
- Reperfusion arrhythmias

## Other Side Effects
- Minor bleeding (e.g., from gums, injection site)
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Hypotension
- Headache
- Dizziness
- Fever

# Interactions
- **Anticoagulants**: Increased risk of bleeding when used with warfarin, heparin, or other anticoagulants.
- **Antiplatelet agents**: May increase the risk of bleeding when used with aspirin or clopidogrel.
- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Concurrent use increases the risk of bleeding. 

It is essential to consult a healthcare professional for monitoring and to discuss potential interactions with other medications.
