# Overview
Streptokinase is a thrombolytic medication used to dissolve blood clots. It is primarily administered in acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and other conditions requiring rapid clot resolution, such as pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. Streptokinase works by activating plasminogen, converting it to plasmin, which breaks down fibrin and thus the blood clot.
