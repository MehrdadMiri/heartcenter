# Lisinopril

## Overview
Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. It can also be used to improve survival after a heart attack. By inhibiting the enzyme that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, Lisinopril helps relax blood vessels, making it easier for the heart to pump blood.

## Main Effects and Uses
- Reduces blood pressure, helping to prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems
- Used to manage heart failure
- Improves survival rates after myocardial infarction (heart attack)
- May be used in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease related to diabetes)

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Angioedema (swelling of the deeper layers of the skin)
- Severe hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Kidney impairment or failure
- Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels in the blood)

### Other Side Effects
- Cough
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Nausea
- Diarrhea
- Rash 
- Elevated blood potassium levels (mild hyperkalemia)
- Changes in taste 

## Interactions
- **Diuretics**: Can enhance the blood pressure-lowering effect, leading to hypotension.
- **Potassium supplements**: May increase the risk of hyperkalemia when taken together.
- **NSAIDs**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce the effectiveness of Lisinopril and increase the risk of renal impairment.
- **Lithium**: Lisinopril can increase lithium levels, which may lead to lithium toxicity.
- **Other antihypertensives**: Combining with other blood pressure medications can potentiate hypotensive effects. 

It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting or stopping Lisinopril or any other medication to ensure safe usage and monitor for potential interactions.
