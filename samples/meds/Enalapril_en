# Enalapril

## Overview
Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart failure. It works by relaxing blood vessels, which helps to lower blood pressure and decrease the workload on the heart.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Hypertension**: Enalapril is prescribed to manage high blood pressure, which helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems.
- **Heart Failure**: It is used in conjunction with other medications to manage heart failure symptoms and improve overall heart function.
- **Left Ventricular Dysfunction**: Enalapril can be beneficial in patients with left ventricular dysfunction post-myocardial infarction (heart attack).
- **Nephropathy**: It may also be prescribed to protect the kidneys in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
- Severe hypotension (significantly low blood pressure)
- Kidney dysfunction or failure
- Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels)
- Liver dysfunction

### Other Side Effects
- Cough
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Nausea
- Rash
- Elevated blood potassium levels (mild)
- Gastrointestinal disturbances (such as diarrhea or constipation)

## Interactions
- **Diuretics**: Concurrent use can increase the risk of hypotension.
- **Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**: May reduce the effectiveness of Enalapril and increase the risk of kidney dysfunction.
- **Potassium Supplements**: Can lead to hyperkalemia.
- **Lithium**: Concurrent use may increase lithium levels and the risk of toxicity.
- **Other antihypertensives**: When combined with other blood pressure medications, there may be an enhanced effect on lowering blood pressure.
