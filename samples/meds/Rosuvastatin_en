# Overview
**Rosuvastatin** is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs known as statins. It is primarily used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood and reduce the risk of heart disease. Rosuvastatin works by inhibiting an enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase) involved in the production of cholesterol in the liver, ultimately lowering LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol.

## Main effects and uses
- Lowers LDL cholesterol levels
- Lowers triglyceride levels
- Increases HDL cholesterol levels
- Reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes
- Helps manage certain types of dyslipidemia (abnormal lipid levels)

# Side effects
## Serious Side Effects
- Muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness (myopathy)
- Rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle breakdown)
- Liver damage (increase in liver enzymes)
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Kidney failure (acute renal failure)

## Other Side Effects
- Nausea

# Interactions
**Rosuvastatin** may interact with the following medications and substances:
- Other cholesterol-lowering medications (e.g., gemfibrozil)
- Certain antiviral drugs (e.g., ritonavir, saquinavir)
- Antifungal medications (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole)
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin)
- Niacin (can increase the risk of muscle-related side effects)
- Calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine)

Patients should always inform their healthcare provider about all medications, supplements, and herbal products they are taking to avoid potential interactions.
