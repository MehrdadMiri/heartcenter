# Verapamil

## Overview
Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker primarily used to treat high blood pressure, angina (chest pain), and certain heart rhythm disorders. It works by relaxing blood vessels, allowing blood to flow more easily and reducing the heart's workload.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Hypertension**: Lowers blood pressure by causing vasodilation.
- **Angina Pectoris**: Helps to prevent angina attacks by increasing coronary blood flow.
- **Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter**: Controls heart rate by slowing down conduction through the AV node.
- **Supraventricular Tachycardia**: Aids in controlling episodes of rapid heart rate.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Severe hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Bradycardia (slowed heart rate)
- Heart block (a conduction disorder)
- Congestive heart failure (worsening of heart failure)
- Allergic reactions (rash, itching, swelling)
- Liver dysfunction (elevated liver enzymes)

### Other Side Effects
- Dizziness or light-headedness
- Fatigue
- Nausea or vomiting
- Constipation
- Headache
- Swelling of the ankles or feet

## Interactions
- **Beta-blockers**: Concurrent use may enhance heart rate-lowering effects and increase the risk of bradycardia and heart block.
- **Digoxin**: May increase digoxin levels leading to toxicity.
- **Grapefruit Juice**: Can increase verapamil blood levels, increasing the risk of side effects.
- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors**: Such as ketoconazole or erythromycin, may increase levels of verapamil.
- **CYP3A4 Inducers**: Such as rifampin, may decrease verapamil efficacy.

**Note**: Always inform healthcare providers about all medications being taken to avoid potential interactions.
