# Evolocumab

## Overview
Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which is involved in cholesterol metabolism. It is primarily used to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia and is often prescribed for individuals who have not achieved adequate cholesterol control with statins alone. It is also indicated for certain patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Lowering LDL Cholesterol**: Evolocumab significantly reduces LDL cholesterol levels when given as an injection.
- **Cardiovascular Risk Reduction**: It is used in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.
- **Adjunct Therapy**: It is often used in conjunction with statins or other lipid-lowering therapies.
- **Familial Hypercholesterolemia**: Particularly effective in patients with genetic conditions leading to high cholesterol levels.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Myocardial infarction (though this is more related to the underlying disease rather than the medication itself)
- Elevated liver enzymes
- Injection site reactions (severe)

### Other Side Effects
- Nasopharyngitis (common cold-like symptoms)
- Back pain
- Injection site reactions (mild to moderate)
- Upper respiratory tract infections
- Muscle pain (myalgia)
- Fatigue
- Nausea

## Drug Interactions
Evolocumab has no significant interactions with statins or other lipid-lowering therapies. However, patients should inform healthcare providers about all medications they are taking to avoid potential interactions. Monitoring should be performed if used in conjunction with other medications that affect lipid metabolism.
