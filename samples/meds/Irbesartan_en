# Overview
Irbesartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used primarily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and to help protect the kidneys in patients with diabetes. It works by relaxing blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and improves blood flow.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Hypertension Management**: Irbesartan is used to lower blood pressure in adults and children over the age of 6. 
- **Kidney Protection in Diabetic Patients**: It is indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, providing renal protection.

# Side Effects
## Serious Side Effects
- **Angioedema**: Swelling of the face, lips, throat, or tongue, which can obstruct breathing.
- **Hypotension**: Severe dropping of blood pressure, especially after the initial dose or if dehydrated.
- **Kidney Dysfunction**: Changes in kidney function tests, acute kidney injury.
- **Elevated Potassium Levels (Hyperkalemia)**: High levels of potassium in the blood which can lead to serious heart problems.

## Other Side Effects
- **Dizziness**: Commonly reported, especially when standing up quickly.
- **Fatigue**: General tiredness or weakness.
- **Nausea**: Some patients may experience feelings of sickness.
- **Headache**: A frequent complaint during treatment.
- **Diarrhea**: Gastrointestinal disturbances can occur.

# Interactions
- **Diuretics**: Co-administration can enhance the effects of irbesartan and increase the risk of hypotension.
- **Other Antihypertensive Agents**: Using with other blood pressure medications may potentiate blood pressure-lowering effects, requiring careful monitoring.
- **Potassium Supplements or Potassium-Sparing Diuretics**: They can elevate potassium levels and increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**: May reduce the antihypertensive effect of irbesartan and worsen renal function in some patients. 

Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting or stopping any medication, and inform them of all medications currently being taken to prevent potential interactions.
