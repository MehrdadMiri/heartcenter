# Ranolazine

## Overview
Ranolazine is an anti-anginal medication commonly used to treat chronic angina (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart) in patients who may not have had adequate relief from other angina therapies. It works by improving blood flow to the heart muscle, thereby reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks.

## Main Effects and Uses
- Primarily used to treat chronic stable angina.
- Can be prescribed alone or in combination with other medications, such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers.
- Helps increase exercise capacity and reduce the symptoms of angina.
- Shows a unique mechanism of action by inhibiting late sodium currents in cardiac myocytes, leading to improved myocardial energy metabolism.

## Side Effects
### Serious Side Effects
- QT prolongation (can lead to serious heart rhythm problems)
- Liver enzyme elevation (possible hepatotoxicity)
- Angina worsening
- Hypotension (low blood pressure)

### Other Side Effects
- Dizziness
- Headache
- Nausea
- Constipation
- Fatigue
- Palpitations
- Dyspnea (shortness of breath)
- Peripheral edema (swelling of the extremities)

## Drug Interactions
- May interact with other medications that prolong the QT interval (e.g., certain antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, and antidepressants).
- Use with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir) should be approached with caution, as they can increase ranolazine levels.
- Co-administration with inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampicin, phenytoin) may decrease ranolazine levels and its effectiveness.

Always consult a healthcare professional or pharmacist when considering potential interactions with other medications.
