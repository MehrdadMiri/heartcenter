# Isosorbide Dinitrate

## Overview
Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitrate medication primarily used to prevent angina pectoris (chest pain) due to coronary artery disease. It works by relaxing blood vessels, which leads to decreased myocardial oxygen demand and relief from angina.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Vasodilation**: Isosorbide dinitrate dilates blood vessels, reducing the workload on the heart.
- **Angina Prevention**: Mainly prescribed for preventing angina attacks.
- **Heart Failure**: Occasionally used in the management of heart failure, particularly in combination with other medications.

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Severe hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Reflex tachycardia (increase in heart rate)
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Syncope (fainting)

### Other Side Effects
- Headache
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Flushing of the skin
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Palpitations
- Skin rash

## Interactions
- **Other Nitrates**: Increased risk of hypotension; use with caution.
- **Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors**: (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) can cause severe hypotension; these medications should not be used within 24-48 hours of each other.
- **Antihypertensive Drugs**: Increased risk of hypotension; monitor blood pressure closely.
- **Alcohol**: May enhance blood pressure lowering effects; use cautiously.

Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting or stopping medication, and to review any potential interactions with other drugs.
