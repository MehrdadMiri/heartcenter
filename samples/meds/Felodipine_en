# Overview
Felodipine is a calcium channel blocker primarily used in the management of hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (chest pain). It works by relaxing the blood vessels, which allows blood to flow more easily, thereby reducing the workload on the heart.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Hypertension:** Felodipine helps to lower blood pressure, reducing the risk of stroke, heart attack, and kidney problems.
- **Angina:** It is used to relieve symptoms of angina by increasing blood flow to the heart muscle.
- **Vasodilation:** The medication causes blood vessels to widen, improving overall circulation.

# Side Effects

## Serious Side Effects
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)
- Swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat
- Rapid or irregular heartbeat
- Severe dizziness or fainting
- Chest pain or worsening angina

## Other Side Effects
- Headache
- Flushing or warmth of the skin
- Peripheral edema (swelling in the legs or ankles)
- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Abdominal pain
- Rash

# Interactions
Felodipine may interact with the following:
- **Other Blood Pressure Medications:** May enhance the hypotensive effect.
- **CYP3A4 Inhibitors:** Medications that inhibit this enzyme can increase systemic levels of felodipine, leading to an increased risk of side effects. Examples include certain antifungals (like ketoconazole) and antibiotics (like erythromycin).
- **Grapefruit Juice:** Consumption can increase plasma levels of felodipine, enhancing its effects and potential side effects.
- **St. Johnâ€™s Wort:** This herbal supplement may reduce the effectiveness of felodipine by inducing CYP3A4.
