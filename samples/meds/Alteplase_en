# Alteplase

## Overview
Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent, commonly known as a "clot buster." It is used to dissolve blood clots that cause conditions such as acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), pulmonary embolism, and ischemic stroke. Alteplase works by converting plasminogen to plasmin, an enzyme that breaks down fibrin, leading to the dissolution of clots.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)**: Alteplase is administered to restore blood flow to the heart muscle in case of a heart attack.
- **Ischemic Stroke**: It is used to treat patients who have suffered an ischemic stroke by dissolving the clot blocking blood flow to the brain.
- **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)**: Alteplase can be used in life-threatening cases of pulmonary embolism to clear the obstructing clot from the pulmonary arteries.
- **Central Venous Catheter Occlusion**: It may also be used to restore patency in occluded central venous catheters.

## Side Effects
### Serious Side Effects
- Hemorrhage (major bleeding)
- Anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)
- Angioedema (swelling under the skin)
- Cardiac arrhythmias

### Other Side Effects
- Minor bleeding (e.g., nosebleeds, easy bruising)
- Nausea and vomiting
- Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Fever
- Pain at the injection site
- Headache
- Dizziness or lightheadedness

## Interactions
Alteplase can interact with several medications and substances, including:
- Anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin): Increased risk of bleeding.
- Antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin, clopidogrel): Considered cautiously due to enhanced bleeding risk.
- Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): May increase bleeding propensity.
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): Increased risk of bleeding.
  
It is essential to administer Alteplase in a controlled setting under strict medical supervision, given the risk of severe side effects, particularly hemorrhage.
