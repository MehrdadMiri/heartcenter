## Overview

### Interactions
- Contraindicated with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil, tadalafil) due to the risk of severe hypotension.
- May interact with other blood pressure medications, leading to increased blood pressure-lowering effects.
- Alcohol can enhance the blood pressure-lowering effects, increasing the risk of side effects such as dizziness and fainting. 

Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting or stopping any medications or if you experience any concerning side effects.
