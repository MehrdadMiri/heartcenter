# Losartan

## Overview
Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that is primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It can also be prescribed to help protect the kidneys in patients with diabetes and to reduce the risk of stroke in some patients.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Main Effects**: Losartan works by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that causes blood vessels to constrict. This leads to relaxation of blood vessels, decreased blood pressure, and improved blood flow.
- **Uses**:
  - Treatment of hypertension
  - Kidney protection in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy
  - Reducing the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy
  - Management of heart failure

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Severe allergic reactions (rash, itching/swelling, severe dizziness, trouble breathing)
- Rapid swelling of face, lips, throat, or tongue (angioedema)
- Low blood pressure (hypotension)
- Kidney problems (changes in urination, swelling in legs/feet)
- Liver problems (yellowing of skin/eyes)

### Other Side Effects
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fatigue
- Nasal congestion
- Cough
- Back pain
- Elevated potassium levels (hyperkalemia)
- Headache
- Gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, diarrhea)

## Interactions
Losartan may interact with certain medications, including:
- Other antihypertensives (may enhance blood pressure-lowering effect)
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (may reduce the antihypertensive effect)
- Potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics (may increase risk of hyperkalemia)
- Lithium (may increase lithium levels, requiring monitoring)
- Certain antidepressants or antipsychotics (may affect blood pressure)

Always consult a healthcare provider for a complete list of potential interactions and to ensure safe use with other medications.
