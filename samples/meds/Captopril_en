# Captopril

## Overview
Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, and to improve survival after a heart attack. By inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, it helps relax blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure and makes it easier for the heart to pump blood.

## Main Effects and Uses
- Reduces high blood pressure
- Treats heart failure
- Protects kidney function in patients with diabetes or certain kidney conditions
- Improves survival rates after myocardial infarction (heart attack)
  
## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- Angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat)
- Severe hypotension (drastic drop in blood pressure)
- Kidney dysfunction (acute kidney injury)
- Hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels in the blood)
- Liver dysfunction (indicated by elevated liver enzymes)
  
### Other Side Effects
- Cough
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Fatigue
- Rash
- Nausea or vomiting
- Headache
- Diarrhea

## Interactions
Captopril may interact with other medications and substances, including:

- **Diuretics**: May increase the risk of hypotension.
- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**: Can reduce the antihypertensive effect of captopril and may impair kidney function.
- **Potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics**: Increase the risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Lithium**: Increases lithium levels and risk of toxicity.
- **Antidiabetic drugs**: May enhance the blood sugar-lowering effect.

## Conclusion
Captopril is an effective medication for managing high blood pressure and heart failure, but it requires careful monitoring due to the potential for serious side effects and interactions with other medications. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting or stopping any medication.
