# Enoxaparin

## Overview
Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) used primarily as an anticoagulant (blood thinner) to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It is often utilized during and after certain surgical procedures, especially in patients with a higher risk of thromboembolism. Enoxaparin works by inhibiting factor Xa and factor IIa (thrombin) in the coagulation cascade, thereby reducing clot formation.

## Main Effects and Uses
- Prevention of DVT in patients undergoing surgery
- Treatment of DVT and PE
- Prevention of complications in patients with unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction
- Management of certain types of heart attack

## Side Effects

### Serious Side Effects
- **Hemorrhage**: Unusual bleeding or bruising
- **Thrombocytopenia**: Low platelet count
- **Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT)**: A potentially life-threatening reaction
- **Severe allergic reactions**: Including anaphylaxis

### Other Side Effects
- Pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site
- Nausea
- Fever
- Elevated liver enzymes
- Skin rash
- Edema
- Osteoporosis with long-term use

## Interactions
- Use with other anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) can increase the risk of bleeding.
- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also heighten bleeding risk.
- Certain medications that affect liver enzymes may alter the metabolism of enoxaparin, thereby affecting its efficacy and safety.

Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting or stopping any medication to determine its appropriateness and monitor for potential side effects and interactions.
