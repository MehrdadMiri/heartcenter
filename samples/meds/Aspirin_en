# Overview
Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties. It is particularly effective in reducing pain, fever, and inflammation. Additionally, aspirin is widely used in low doses for its antiplatelet effects to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

## Main Effects and Uses
- **Pain Relief**: Effective in managing mild to moderate pain (e.g., headaches, muscle aches, menstrual pain).
- **Fever Reduction**: Lowers fever associated with infections or other medical conditions.
- **Anti-inflammatory**: Reduces inflammation in conditions such as arthritis.
- **Antiplatelet Effect**: Inhibits platelet aggregation, thus lowering the risk of thrombotic events, making it useful in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

# Side Effects

## Serious Side Effects
- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Ulcers in the stomach or intestines
- Reye's syndrome (particularly in children and teenagers with viral infections)
- Severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis)

# Drug Interactions
- **Anticoagulants**: Increased risk of bleeding when taken with warfarin or other blood thinners.
- **Other NSAIDs**: Increased risk of gastrointestinal side effects or renal impairment.
- **SSRIs**: Risk of bleeding may be increased when used with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
- **Methotrexate**: Aspirin can increase the plasma concentration of methotrexate, leading to toxicity.
- **Alcohol**: Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. 

Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting or combining medications, especially if there are existing health conditions or concurrent medication use.
