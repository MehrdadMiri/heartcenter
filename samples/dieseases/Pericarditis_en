# Pericarditis

## General Information
Pericarditis is the inflammation of the pericardium, which is the thin, sac-like membrane surrounding the heart. This inflammation can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac (pericardial effusion), which may affect the heart's ability to function properly. Pericarditis can be acute (sudden onset) or chronic (lasting longer than three months) and can occur in isolation or as part of a more complex disease process.

### Causes
The exact cause of pericarditis may vary; however, it is commonly attributed to:

- Viral infections (e.g., Coxsackie virus, echovirus, and influenza)
- Bacterial infections
- Fungal infections
- Autoimmune diseases (e.g., lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma)
- Post-myocardial infarction (Dressler's syndrome)
- Post-surgical complications (e.g., after heart surgery)
- Cancer or radiation therapy
- Kidney failure/dialysis

### Risk Factors
- Recent viral infections
- Autoimmune diseases
- Certain medications
- History of heart surgery or heart attacks

## Symptoms
The symptoms of pericarditis may vary based on its cause and severity. Common symptoms include:

1. **Chest pain**: 
   - Sharp, pleuritic (worse with deep breathing or coughing)
   - May improve when sitting up or leaning forward
2. **Fever**: 
   - Mild to moderate fever may be present
3. **Shortness of breath**: 
   - This may occur when lying flat (orthopnea)
4. **Fatigue**: 
   - General feeling of tiredness or weakness
5. **Cough**: 
   - Dry cough may accompany other symptoms
6. **Palpitations**: 
   - Sensation of rapid or irregular heartbeats
7. **Swelling**: 
   - Mild swelling in the legs or abdomen can occur, particularly with significant fluid buildup

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis of pericarditis typically involves a combination of:

- **Medical history and physical exam**: Assessment of symptoms and signs of inflammation.
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: May show specific changes in the heart rhythm associated with pericarditis.
- **Echocardiogram**: Imaging to evaluate pericardial effusion and heart function.
- **Chest X-ray**: Used to check for enlarged heart or fluid.
- **Blood tests**: To detect signs of inflammation and possible infectious agents.

## Treatment
Treatment for pericarditis depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Options may include:

- **Medications**:
  - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or aspirin to reduce pain and inflammation.
  - Corticosteroids may be prescribed for autoimmune-related pericarditis.
  - Colchicine is sometimes used to prevent recurrences.

- **Surgery** (in severe cases):
  - Pericardiocentesis: Drainage of excess fluid from around the heart.
  - Pericardiectomy: Surgical removal of the pericardium in chronic cases.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for pericarditis varies. Many cases resolve without complications, particularly when treated early. However, chronic pericarditis can lead to complications such as cardiac tamponade (pressure on the heart due to fluid buildup) or constrictive pericarditis, which can significantly affect heart function.

### Conclusion
Pericarditis is a potentially serious condition that requires prompt medical evaluation and treatment. If you experience symptoms such as chest pain, especially when accompanied by other signs of inflammation, seeking immediate medical attention is crucial.
